# Laptop Price Prediction

## Overview

This project utilizes the "laptops.csv" dataset to implement and compare the performance of two machine learning algorithms:
 Decision Tree and Random Forest. The dataset contains information about laptops, including various technical specifications
 such as brand, CPU, GPU, and the corresponding price.

## Dataset

The "laptops.csv" file serves as our dataset, with each row representing a laptop and columns capturing specific technical
requirements. The final column indicates the price of each laptop. The objective is to predict whether a laptop's price is
below or above the average based on its technical specifications.

## Preprocessing

To facilitate the application of machine learning algorithms, several preprocessing steps have been undertaken. Firstly,
 a function was implemented to calculate the average price using the provided data. Subsequently, all non-numeric values
 in each column were transformed into numeric values, ensuring compatibility with the algorithms.

## Algorithms

Two algorithms, Decision Tree and Random Forest, have been employed for the price prediction task. These algorithms analyze
the relationships between technical specifications and laptop prices, enabling the model to generalize and make predictions
on unseen data.

## Decision Tree Visualization

As part of the analysis, the results of the Decision Tree algorithm are visualized through a plotted tree. This visualization
aids in understanding the decision-making process of the model, showcasing how specific technical requirements influence the
predicted price.
